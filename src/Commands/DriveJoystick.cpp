/*This command gets two axis inputs from the left and right y-axis of the driver controller in OI, 
then adds a dead-zone (if axis value is within 0.1 of 0, make it 0). 
Finally, it sends this value to the SetTankDrive method of the drivetrain subsystem.
When it ends, or is interrupted, set SetTankDrive to 0, 0 to stop the robot. 
Also add a check using the Joystick::GetIsXbox method to change the y value axis 
if the controller is a joystick vs an xbox gamepad. */
