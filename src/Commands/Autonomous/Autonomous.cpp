	 * When we have the Jetson machine learning running, we'll have a command that reads values from the Jetson to the roboRIO.
	 * This might be called AddSequential(new ReadJetson);
	 * Then, that command will set the value of a Robot::Defense variable.
	 * Finally, we'll do AddSequential(new BreachAuto(Some Robot::Defense value)); which will automatically do what's needed to breach the command.
